# MyFlixAngularClient

## Description
This app provides a frontend for the MyFlix API. It allows users to sign up, log in, view information about movies, and add movies to their list of favorites. The server-side code and documentation for this app can be found in this [repository]("https://github.com/OtmarKirch/sci-fi-app"). A frontend has already been written in React, which you can find [here]("https://github.com/OtmarKirch/MySciFi-client"). This project is a rewrite of the frontend in Angular.

The app is currently in development. The following features have been implemented:
- The endpoints for the API
- Basic starting view
- User registration

## Key Features
At the end of development, the app will have the following features:
- Your app should display a welcome view where users will be able to either log in or register an account.
